# Doppler Overview

## What is Doppler?

Doppler is a SecretOps Platform designed to simplify secrets management for teams of all sizes. The platform aims to help developers manage configuration and secrets more efficiently across development and production environments.

Doppler's secrets management platform helps teams secure, sync, and automate their secrets across environments and infrastructure. It's designed to eliminate secrets sprawl and provide enhanced security, agility, and automation through a centralized cloud platform.

## Key Problems Doppler Solves

### Secrets Sprawl
49% of breaches involve credentials, with 86% of web application attacks stemming from stolen credentials. Traditional approaches like `.env` files or environment variables break down quickly as services and teams grow.

### Cost of Secret Management
1Password estimates the cost of a company losing control of its secrets at $1.2 million per year. Additionally, DevOps and IT workers said they spend an average of 25 minutes each day managing secrets â€“ which the company estimated to add up to an annual payroll expense of roughly $8.5 billion.

### Scale and Complexity
65% of companies juggle more than 500 secrets, and 18% said they have "more than they can count".

## Core Features

- **Secrets Management**: Centralized storage and management of sensitive configuration data
- **Fine-grained Access Controls**: Role-based permissions for projects and environments
- **Activity Logging**: Complete audit trail of all secret changes
- **Secret Versioning**: Track changes and roll back when needed
- **Cross-platform CLI Support**: Works across all major operating systems

## Key Benefits

### Security
- Eliminates the need for scattered `.env` files
- Provides centralized access control
- Maintains comprehensive audit logs

### Developer Experience
- Quick integration (typically 30 minutes)
- Seamless CLI for local development
- Real-time secret synchronization

### Team Collaboration
- Unified source of truth for all configurations
- Environment-specific secret management
- Team-based access controls

## Platform Architecture

Doppler is built around several key concepts:

1. **Workplaces**: Top-level organizational units
2. **Projects**: Application or service-specific containers
3. **Environments**: Development stages (dev, staging, production)
4. **Configs**: Specific configurations within environments
5. **Secrets**: The actual sensitive values being managed

## Integration Ecosystem

Doppler supports integrations with:
- Cloud Providers (AWS, GCP, Azure, Vercel)
- Container Platforms (Docker, Kubernetes)
- CI/CD Systems (GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, CircleCI)
- Infrastructure as Code (Terraform, Ansible)
- Application Frameworks (Node.js, Python, Go, Ruby)
