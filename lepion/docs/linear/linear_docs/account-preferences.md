# Account Preferences

Adjust your preferences to help you move faster and personalize your workflow in Linear.

## General Preferences

### Default Home View

Sets the default view that opens when you log into Linear or reopen the app.

**Default**: Team's Active issues view (shows all Unstarted or Started issues)

**Available options**:
- All issues
- Active issues
- Current cycle
- Inbox
- My Issues
- Favorited Views
- Favorited Projects

### Display Full Names

Choose how team members appear throughout Linear:
- **Full names**: Shows complete names as set in profiles
- **Usernames**: Shows personalized usernames from profile settings

### First Day of the Week

Customize calendar displays to match your preferred week start day.

### Convert Text Emoticons into Emojis

Enable automatic conversion of text emoticons (like :) or :D) into emoji characters for faster emoji input.

## Interface and Theme

### Display Settings
- Adjust font size for better readability
- Option to use pointer cursor when hovering over interactive elements

### Theme Options
- **Presets**: Choose from built-in Light or Dark modes
- **System preference**: Automatically switch based on computer settings
- **Custom themes**: Build your own or use community themes from [linear.style](https://linear.style/)

## Desktop Application

### Link Behavior
Control whether Linear links open in:
- Web browser
- Desktop application (when installed)

### Desktop Features
- **Notification badges**: Show/hide badge counts on desktop app icon
- **Spell check**: Enable spell checking for text input

## Automations and Workflows

### Auto-assign to Self

Automatically assigns any issue you create to yourself.

**Use cases**:
- Creating personal task lists
- Bulk issue creation for projects
- Temporary enablement during sprints

**Alternative**: Use `Cmd/Ctrl + Shift + Enter` when creating issues to create multiple with the same assignee.

### Git Integration Settings

#### Git Attachment Format
Choose display format for git attachments:
- Title only
- Title and repository

#### Git Branch Copy Actions
When copying branch names with `Cmd/Ctrl + Shift + .`:

1. **Move issue to In Progress**: Automatically transitions issue to first "Started" workflow status
2. **Auto-assign to yourself**: Claims ownership when starting work

**Recommendation**: Enable both settings for developers to save clicks and maintain workflow consistency.

## Tips and Best Practices

- Customize your default home view based on your role and daily workflow
- Use custom themes to reduce eye strain or match your development environment
- Enable git automations if you're a developer to streamline issue management
- Consider auto-assign settings based on whether you primarily work solo or collaboratively
