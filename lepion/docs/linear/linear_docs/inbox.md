# Inbox

The Inbox is your notification center in Linear and where you'll find important updates on issues in your workspace.

## Overview

Your Linear Inbox receives notifications for key events on subscribed issues. You're automatically subscribed to issues when you:
- Create them
- Are assigned to them
- Are mentioned in descriptions or comments

**Note**: All notifications go to your Inbox—this cannot be customized. However, you can filter notifications and configure additional alerts in **Settings > My Account > Notifications**.
