## 🚀 Quick Setup (5 minutes)

### Step 1: Create Your First Issue
**To start, press `C` to create your first issue.**

Create issues from any view using `C` or by clicking the `New issue` button.

### Step 2: Learn the Command Palette

Use it to search for or take any action in the app. Try it now!

### Step 3: Master Essential Shortcuts
| Action | Shortcut | Description |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| **`C`** | Create issue | Start new work item |
| **`Cmd/Ctrl + K`** | Command palette | Universal search and actions |
| **`G` then `I`** | Go to issues | Navigate to issues view |
| **`?`** | Help | View all keyboard shortcuts |
| **`/`** | Quick search | Find anything quickly |

If you prefer using a mouse, **right-click** over any issue for contextual menus.

## 📝 Your First Workflow

### 1. Create Issues
Issues represent tasks, bugs, features, or any work item:
- **Press `C`** to create
- Add clear, actionable titles
- Use descriptions for acceptance criteria
- Set priority and assignee

### 2. Organize with Labels
- **Type**: bug, feature, improvement
- **Area**: frontend, backend, design
- **Priority**: P0, P1, P2
- **Status**: needs-review, blocked

### 3. Track Progress
- Move issues through workflow states
- Use **Board view** for visual Kanban
- Filter by assignee, status, or labels

## 🏗️ Key Concepts

### Issues
The fundamental unit in Linear representing work items:
- **Identifier**: Unique ID (e.g., ENG-123)
- **Status**: Backlog → Todo → In Progress → Done
- **Priority**: Urgent (1) to Low (4)
- **Properties**: Assignee, labels, estimates, due dates

### Teams
Organizational units with their own:
- Issue identifier prefix (e.g., ENG-, DESIGN-)
- Workflow states
- Labels and settings
- Members and permissions

### Projects
Collections of issues working toward a specific goal:
- Target dates and milestones
- Progress tracking
- Cross-team collaboration
- Status updates

### Cycles
Time-boxed periods (typically 1-2 weeks) for planning work:
- **Active cycle**: Current sprint
- **Upcoming cycle**: Next planned work
- **Cooldown**: Buffer between cycles

## ✨ Editor Features

Linear's editor supports rich content:

### Formatting
- **Markdown support**: Headers, lists, code blocks
- **@mentions**: Notify teammates
- **Drag & drop**: Images and videos
- **Embeds**: Loom, YouTube, Figma automatically embed
- **Emoji support**: ✅ 🎉 🚀

### Slash Commands
Type **`/`** in any text field for formatting options:
- `/todo` - Checkable task list
- `/code` - Code block with syntax highlighting
- `/quote` - Blockquote
- `/table` - Insert table

## 🔧 Essential Integrations

Set up these integrations to streamline your workflow:

### 1. Slack Integration
If your team uses Slack:
- See issue updates in dedicated channels
- Use `/linear` command to create issues from Slack
- Sync comments between platforms
- Set up personal notifications
- Import custom emoji 🥳

**Setup**: [Integrations Guide](integrations.md#slack)

### 2. GitHub Integration
For development teams:
- Auto-link pull requests to issues
- Update issue status on PR events
- Branch naming automation
- Sync code reviews

**Setup**: [GitHub Integration Guide](integrations.md#github)

## 📊 Planning with Cycles

Cycles help maintain team momentum (similar to agile sprints):

### Cycle Benefits
- **Flexible duration**: 1-8 weeks
- **Automatic planning**: Move Todo issues to current cycle
- **Progress tracking**: Visual cycle graphs
- **Rollover**: Incomplete issues move to next cycle

### Running Cycle Meetings
**✨ ProTip**: Use the cycles sidebar for standups:
1. Filter issues by assignee
2. Ask each member for updates and blockers
3. Adjust priorities and assignments

*At Linear, we run 2-week cycles using this format.*

## 🎯 Project Management

Projects are for larger initiatives:

### Project Features
- **Multi-team sharing**: Collaborate across teams
- **Target dates**: Set milestones and deadlines
- **Progress graphs**: Visual completion tracking
- **Documentation**: Add overviews and resources
- **Status updates**: Keep everyone informed

### Getting Started with Projects
1. **Create project**: Press `Cmd/Ctrl + K` → "New project"
2. **Add issues**: Use `Shift + P` to assign existing issues
3. **Set milestones**: Break down into deliverable chunks
4. **Track progress**: Use project graphs and updates

## 👥 Team Management

### Inviting Team Members
1. Go to **Settings → Members**
2. Send invitations via email
3. Set appropriate roles and permissions
4. Configure team access levels

### Roles and Permissions
