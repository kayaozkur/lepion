# Pull Request Reviews

View and comment on pull request reviews directly from Linear.

## Overview

The Pull Request Reviews feature integrates GitHub PRs into Linear, streamlining your code review workflow. Access a dedicated Reviews section in your sidebar to:

- View PRs awaiting your review
- See PRs you've authored
- Comment on PR discussions
- Receive review request notifications

**Note**: Code review and approval actions still require opening PRs in GitHub.

## Setup

### Enable Reviews

1. Navigate to **Settings > Connected Accounts**
2. Connect your GitHub account if not already connected
3. Toggle on "Enable pull request reviews inside Linear"

Once enabled, the Reviews section appears in your sidebar.

## Display and Grouping

### Default View: Responsibility Grouping

PRs are organized into three categories:
- **To Do**: PRs requiring your review
- **Waiting for others**: PRs you've commented on or authored
- **Approved**: PRs you've approved

### Customization Options

#### Grouping Options
- **Responsibility** (default)
- **Status**: Draft, Open, Merged, Closed
- **Author**: Grouped by PR creator
- **Repository**: Organized by source repository
- **No Grouping**: Flat list view

#### Display Settings
