# My Issues

See your most important issues in one centralized view.

## Overview

My Issues is a curated view that organizes your most pertinent issues across four tabs:
- **Assigned**: Issues assigned to you
- **Created**: Issues you've created
- **Subscribed**: Issues you're following
- **Activity**: Recent issue activity

## Quick Access

### Navigation
- **Keyboard shortcut**: `G` then `M`
- **Sidebar**: Located under Inbox in the top left

### Subscription Management
- **Subscribe**: `Shift + S`
- **Unsubscribe**: `Cmd/Ctrl + Shift + S`
- **Via menu**: Click three dots in Activity section

## Assigned Issues Tab

### Focus Grouping (Default)

My Issues uses a unique "Focus" grouping that prioritizes issues in order of importance:

1. **Urgent Issues**: Critical priority items
2. **SLA Issues**: Items with service level agreements
3. **Blocking Issues**: Your issues blocking others
4. **Current Cycle**: Issues in active sprint (optional)
5. **Future Cycles**: Upcoming sprint issues (optional)
6. **Other Active**: In-progress issues not in above categories
7. **Triage**: Items needing review (optional)
8. **Backlog**: Unstarted issues
9. **Done**: Completed work
10. **Cancelled**: Closed without completion

**Within each group**: Issues are ordered by priority, with started issues appearing first.

### Customization
Change grouping options using [display options](../views-navigation/display-options.md) in the top-right corner.

## Created Issues Tab

View all issues you've created, including those from:
- Direct creation in Linear
- Slack integrations
- Support tools (Front, Intercom, Zendesk)
